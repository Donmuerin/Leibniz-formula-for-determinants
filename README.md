# Reference:
#Reference1: Code refers to heap pseudo-algorithm from wikipedia

Where in conclusion, it stated that Heap's algorithm is slightly more effecient and can code faster

#Reference3: I got a better understanding by watching the following video

Note: used bubble sort to count steps (duplicate), could have done better.
